# TNFDB
A structure-based TNFSF-TNFRSF interactome
All relevant information of the TNFSF-TNFRSF interactome can be found under this repository.
Specifically, the repository contains the list of all 194 interactions identified from PrePPI. 
It also includes the structural models of ligand-receptor complexes for all these 194 interactions. 
The atomic coordinates of all structural models are in the PDB format. 
Finally, the calculated binding free energy and dissociation constant of all interactions are also presented.
